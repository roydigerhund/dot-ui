# Dot UI

This is a just-for-fun project to create a simple UI based on dots.

The goal is to have a composer in which you can create multiple states of dots and transitions between them.

A deployed version of the project can be found [here](dot-ui-two.vercel.app).

## How to run

`yarn dev` to run the project in development mode.

`yarn build` to build the project.
